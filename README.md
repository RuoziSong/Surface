We enjoy a lot the great food in New York. But at the same time, we also hope to take sanitation condition into consideration when we decide where to eat. Unfortunately, commercial apps like Yelp donâ€™t include this information probably becaurse of its commercial purpose. Thus we came up with idea to use interactive data visualization to enable consumers know more about sanitation condition of restaurants in New York.

By generating the interactive maps about restaurant sanitation inspection performance in New York City, we are able to see both individual and aggregate level of restaurtant performance. Please read our main results in file 'final_report_Surface.html'.

The data folder can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xgeo9fpmti6kbb2/AACj7_UQxXgWwPPkhlsYCQaXa?dl=0). 

The Shiny app can be found [here](https://surface-eda.shinyapps.io/Surface/).

Our original restaurant inspection data is from NYC open data ([here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/xx67-kt59/data). The zipcode boundaries data used in our analysis is from [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/Zip-Code-Boundaries/i8iw-xf4u/data).
